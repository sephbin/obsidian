#### Sudden Block (Su)

As an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder a melee attack made against you or an adjacent ally. Add your tier to your AC or the allyâ€™s AC against this attack. The creature making the attack must make two [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) and take the lower result. Once the attack is resolved, you or your ally (your choice) can make one melee attack against the creature. The damage from this attack bypasses all [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction).

#### Adamantine Mind (Ex)

Your mind is as hard as any [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), and is dangerous to engage. You gain a bonus equal to your tier on saving throws against [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effects. Whenever you succeed at a save against a [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effect, the creature attacking you with that effect must succeed at a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save (at the same DC) or be [stunned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned) for 1 round.

#### Retributive Reach (Ex)

Treat your reach as 5 feet greater than normal for the purpose of determining whether or not you can make an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). If a creature provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) within this area of increased reach, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus equal to your tier on the [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) and damage roll of the attack of opportunity.

#### Draw Fire (Su)

As an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), when an ally within 30 feet is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, you can have that attack target you instead. If you would normally be out of range for that attack, the attack is able to hit you as if you were at maximum range. You can use this ability without using an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions) by expending one use of mythic power.


#### Turn the Tables (Ex)

If a creature fails a [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check made against you, as an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions) you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt that same maneuver against that creature. You receive a +10 bonus on this [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check.
