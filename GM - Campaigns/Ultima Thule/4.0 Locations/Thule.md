Thule is a unique city built on a massive, levitating disc. This disc, propelled by an unknown force, travels endlessly through the cosmos, teleporting to planets and absorbing their resources before moving on. The inhabitants of Thule are the descendants of refugees from planets that Thule ravaged in its travels. This diverse population has led to a city with a patchwork of cultures, conflicting ideologies, and a constant struggle for survival.

**Key Features:**

- **Nomadic:** Thule's constant movement fosters a sense of impermanence and transience. People cling to their cultural traditions but also readily adapt and integrate with others due to necessity.
- **Resource Scarcity:** Thule's technology is a blend of advanced and primitive. While advanced technology exists, its use is heavily rationed due to resource limitations. This creates a unique dynamic where both high tech and low tech solutions co-exist. This split corelates between the rich and poor respectively.
- **Cultural Diversity:** The diverse population of Thule results in a vibrant mix of customs, languages, and religions. This diversity can be a source of strength and unity, but it also creates friction and conflict.
- **Political Instability:** Thule lacks a central government and instead operates through a complex network of oligarchs, factions and alliances called the [[Axial Syndicate]]. These factions vie for power and influence, often resorting to intrigue and manipulation.
- **Unknown Destination:** The mystery surrounding Thule's destination and the force that propels it adds a layer of intrigue and uncertainty to the city's life. This uncertainty fuels both hope and despair among the populace.

**Technology:**

- **Advanced Tech:** Remnants of high technology from the ravaged planets can be found in Thule. These include energy weapons, advanced medical equipment, and powerful vehicles. However, these resources are limited and jealously guarded.
- **Fantasy Tech:** Alongside the advanced technology, Thule utilizes magic and alchemy based on the traditions of its inhabitants. These include elemental manipulation, healing potions, and enchanted weaponry.
- **Resource Consumption:** All forms of technology in Thule, both advanced and fantasy, require a significant amount of resources to operate. This resource scarcity forces the inhabitants to be resourceful and innovative in their usage.

**Factions:**

- **Conservatives:** Seek to preserve the traditions and cultures of their ancestors, often distrusting new technologies and ideas.
- **Progressives:** Embrace change and innovation, believing that adapting to Thule's unique environment is key to survival.
- **Technocrats:** Seek to control and utilize advanced technology to gain power and influence over the city.
- **Mystics:** Focus on harnessing the power of magic and alchemy to understand and control Thule's destiny.
- **Outlanders:** Recent refugees from ravaged planets who struggle to integrate into Thule's existing society.

**Campaign Hooks:**
