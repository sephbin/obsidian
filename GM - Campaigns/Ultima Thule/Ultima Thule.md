"Ultima Thule" is a science fantasy tabletop role-playing game inspired by Disco-Elysium, Terry Pratchet and modern philosophy. The game features satirical political themes, eccentric characters, mysteries and action. The title means "the farthest point", referring to the main location of the setting and the extreme nature of some of the ideologies presented.

## Setting
**Ultima Thule** is set predominantly in the city of Thule. The campaign setting is set up so that the surrounding context Thule is traveling is constantly changing. One year Thule may be on a completely uninhabited planet, with extreme magical weather, or a inhabited planet waging war on the city, with high technology and political intrigue. Either way, most adventures can be quite insular, only focusing on the ongoings of Thules inhabitants.
### Thule
The central location is the city "Thule", a unique city built on a massive, levitating disc. This disc, propelled by an unknown force, travels endlessly through the meta-cosmos, teleporting to planets and absorbing their resources before moving on. The inhabitants of Thule are the descendants of refugees from planets that Thule ravaged in its travels. This diverse population has led to a city with a patchwork of cultures, conflicting ideologies, and a constant struggle for survival.

### Magic and Technology
There isn't a major distinction between Magic and Technology in Thule, the inhabitants refer to it as magescience rather than science of magic. Whatever is understood as magic is just another natural occurrence in the universe like electricity or gravity. Magscience requires energy just as much as non-fictional science, and so the people of Thule use it sparingly, whilst also looking for new advancements in the magescience field for profit and lifestyle improvement.
Because of the nature of Thules traversal through spacetime, it is hard for the city to set up resource gathering, like farming or mining, and so energy consumption need to be efficient and rationed.
### Liminal Physics
There is currently major developments into the physics field of "Liminal Particles", this is magescience that goes beyond "Quantum Physics". Its in a developmental stage within Thule, but companies are using it to develop space-expanding products, such as storage containers that are larger on the inside than the outside.
