Panic rippled across Manifest district like a rogue wave today as the Liminal Futures Corporation's latest experiment went spectacularly sideways. The test, designed to utilize the enigmatic properties of liminal particles for controlled space-time manipulation, instead resulted in a series of disconcerting shifts. Buildings tilted precariously, streets warped like melting cheese, and citizens found themselves flung through the air like ragdolls caught in a celestial waltz.

"One moment I was adjusting the resonance modulator," confessed Dr. Xenon Praxis, lead scientist on the project, his face pale and hair askew, "and the next, my workbench was halfway down the street!"

Chaos erupted as gravity played hopscotch across the district. Reports flooded in of levitating lampposts, alleged sentient furniture, and a particularly disgruntled arithmetic daemon clogging the central maniport terminal. While no serious injuries were reported, the incident has left Manifest's citizens shaken and questioning the wisdom of meddling with the very fabric of reality.

"The experiment was designed with fail-safes!" Dr. Praxis protested amidst the cacophony, "But clearly, something went terribly wrong."

The Syndicate has already launched an investigation, demanding answers and assurances that such an incident will not be repeated. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories run rampant in the bustling marketplace. Whispers of rogue daemons, disgruntled engineers, and even divine intervention fill the air as thick as the scent of ozone after a dimensional hop.
