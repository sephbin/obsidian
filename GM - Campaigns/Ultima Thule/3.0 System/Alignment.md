Good vs Evil, Law vs Chaos. Heaven blessed champions, bright nimbus warriors of light clashing against the ultimate forces of desecating evil. Foul creatures in the darkness plotting to end humankind, insepid demons utilising sedition and corruption to fuel their wretched desires. These tropes have their place, but really do cause issues when players come to the table to create compelling characters and complex storylines.
I like stealing "psuedo" sciences for fantasy and sci-fi roleplaying. In this case, the following alignment rules are based on Moral Foundations theory, created by a group of serious academics, sociologists and political scientists. I see it like a modern day zodiac, like a personality test, or teenagers magazine quiz categorisation.
It's fun, and a bit silly and makes you think about how your character fits in the world, and might even give you some prompts to develop your character further.
Ultimately, it supercedes the CLEG system of pathfinder because that lense of a story doesn't work well in Thule. The bad guys aren't evil, they just aren't you.

Morals, ethics and virtues are complicated and flawed, and I encourage you to take on both the benefits and consequences of this to fit into the theme.

This system is built to be subjective. You will have two characters they may have the exact same alignment, but because of their history and context, they may not see eye to eye. They may be friends, allies or even enemies.

Pick an alignment foundation to gain a rank 2
Pick a second alignment foundation to gain a rank 1

These ranks are used to create bonuses or penalties with skill checks, attack rolls or saving throws.
These bonuses are available with any skill check or attack roll as long as they can be justified in their use.
Example 1:
	Max Gland has a rank 2 in Cheating and a rank 1 in Loyalty. He works the crowd in a three card monte gang, spotting marks and pick pocketing them when they are distracted. He gains a +2 with bluff or diplomacy when coercing marks over to watch and play. When one of his gang betrays the group to the police, and lies to Max, he takes a -1 penalty on the sense motive. During interogation, Max is forced to resist a truth telling spell to reveal more about his gang and family, he gains a +1 bonus to this roll. Later, Max is released on bail with strict conditions not to conspire with his gang. He tries to follow the rules to avoid getting in trouble, but must roll against a self control roll with a -1 penalty.

Example 2:
	Susan Random has a rank 2 in Sanctity and a rank 1 in Harm. She is a high strung psycopath, nuerotic about filth and hates foreign refugees. She stalks homeless refugees at night to murder them, sneaking along she stabs one in the neck with a +1 to the attack roll. She tussles with the man and is dragged down into the grimmy gutter where she begins to retch from the filth with a -2 penalty to the Fortitude save. She manages to prevail over the man and in that moment she considers what she is doing, and must check against a self control roll with -1 to the outcome, she ignores her conscience and murders the poor vagrant. Assesing the crim scene, she begins to clean up after herself gaining a +2 to the Survival and Disguise roll to hide her tracks and tidy herself up.

Example 3:
	Shhhhhhk ksh has a rank 2 in Authority and rank 1 in Degradation. It is shambling zombie under the  control of the local high street necromancer. Shhhhhhk gains a +2 to rolls that fullfil the direct commands of its master. When a wandering flesh eating virus stumbles upon Shhhhhhhk, it gets a -1 to resist the Fort save. Oh no Shhhhhhk's leg fell off!

The **Care/Harm** foundation developed through the protection of children—our ancestors cared for their children and helped them avoid harm in hopes of witnessing the survival of their genes in future generations. The Care/Harm foundation is seen in contemporary politics when Liberals put a “Save Darfur” bumper sticker on their car or when Conservatives do the same with a “Wounded Warriors” sticker. These are causes that interest us because we care about the individuals involved and wish for them to avoid harm. Interestingly, Liberals rely more on the Care/Harm foundation than Conservatives—this is evident in Liberal critiques of “heartless” Conservative policies on healthcare, education, or government spending.

The **Fairness/Cheating** foundation evolved through self-interest and reciprocal altruism. All organisms are self-interested, but once our ancestors developed the ability to remember past interactions, they could perform altruistic deeds with the expectation of a returned favor. They could also enforce consequences for a violation of such trust. Today, the Left demonstrates the Fairness/Cheating foundation when discussing social justice—think of debates about economic inequality in which Democrats argue that the wealthy are “not paying their fair share.” The Right demonstrates the Fairness/Cheating foundation when it argues that the government takes money from hardworking Americans (through taxes) and gives it to lazy people (on welfare and unemployment) and illegal immigrants (through healthcare and education). When speaking about fairness, Liberals are generally alluding to equality while Conservatives are generally alluding to proportionality. Hence, the disconnect—at least in part. Liberals still rely more on the fairness foundation than Conservatives, but more on that to come.

The **Authority/Subversion** foundation was also developed in our tribal pasts. For a group to survive, a societal structure had to be established with a leader and followers. In politics today, the Authority/Subversion foundation applies to traditions, institutions, and values. It is more natural for Conservatives to rely on this foundation than Liberals, who define themselves in opposition to hierarchy, inequality, and power.

The **Loyalty/Betrayal** foundation developed as our ancestors addressed adaptive challenges in coalitions. Loyalty to the group, and hence survival, was favored evolutionarily. Today, the human predilection for in-group loyalty remains and accounts for a large part of the political “us versus them” divide. The Right relies on the Loyalty/Betrayal foundation when framing debates in terms of nationalism, such as the recent debate about NFL players kneeling for the national anthem. Generally, Conservatives express this foundation more than Liberals.

The **Sanctity/Degradation** foundation was developed through the adaptive challenges of avoiding pathogens, parasites, and other existential threats originating from physical touch or proximity. Judged on a scale from neophilia (an attraction to new things) to neophobia (a fear of new things), Liberals score much higher for neophilia (for food, people, music, ideas) than Conservatives, who prefer to stick with what is tried and true, guarding boundaries and traditions. Social Conservatives particularly rely on the Sanctity/Degradation foundation when discussing the sanctity of life (in the abortion debate), the sanctity of marriage (in the gay rights debate), and the sanctity of self (in the contraception debate).

Through a later work, Haidt added a sixth moral foundation: the **Liberty/Oppression** foundation. Like the Authority/Subversion foundation, the Liberty/Oppression foundation evolved from the dynamics of group behavior, and it views authority as legitimate only in certain contexts. Both sides flex this foundation frequently. The Left relies on it in critiques of the wealthy, such as Occupy Wall Street, and in favor of those they view as victims and powerless groups. The Right flexes it in a more parochial way, concerned with the specific groups to which they belong. Conservatives say, “Don’t tread on me,” to Big Government in response to high taxes. They extend the argument to the spheres of business and nation, objecting to regulatory policy and international treaties, such as those created by the United Nations.
