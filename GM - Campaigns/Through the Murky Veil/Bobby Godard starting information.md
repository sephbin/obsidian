A few days ago Mr. Preston requested a meeting with you, today at his estate outside of Arkham. Apart from the meeting request, the message mentioned he has an assignment for you that will require time away from the docks, and to find a suitable replacement for yourself while you are gone. Mr. Saulnier is perfect for the job, and if it weren't for his complete loyalty, he would have taken the position from you years ago. That has given you time to ponder why Preston needs your help on anything other than dockyard security. Could this be connected to that missing fishing boat? Probably not... Preston doesn't deal with food. Although you did see mention of the business branching into insurance. Recently you've found yourself distracted by the sea, debris and rocks for a brief moment trick your eye into thinking there are whales in the harbour, and there's that dream that wakes you up before you need to piss. Your body feels like its slowly becoming gelatinous and transparent, like a jelly fish, a rushing liquid sensation flowing in all directions from you. A few nights you catch yourself before you wet the bed. There it is again, a distraction from what's important. You make sure you have all the tools of the trade before you head to the meeting, who knows, you might not have a chance to head back home, Preston has come to anticipate you being ready for anything, and this assignment can be no exception.
