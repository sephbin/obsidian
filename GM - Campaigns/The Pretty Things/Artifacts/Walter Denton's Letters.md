Below are the letter's of Quartermaster Walter Denton to his superiors

Dear Sir,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I write to you as a concerned quartermaster officer. While the camp maintains an air of calmness, I am burdened with suspicions that we may have an enemy spy lurking within our ranks, working for the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Allow me to outline the individuals who have caught my attention as potential suspects. First and foremost is the Australian officer, Lieutenant Arthur Cotton. Though he has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, I cannot shake off my reservations about his activities during the night. His clandestine behavior raises red flags and begs further investigation. I must admit that I confronted him directly about my concerns, only to discover that his nighttime escapades were centered around a romantic encounter. Nevertheless, I remain cautious of his actions and continue to observe him closely.

In addition to Lieutenant Cotton, there is a group of Aboriginal soldiers stationed with us. I find it challenging to place my trust in individuals who do not speak English. I have demanded they speak only English in my precense and they defy me! One particular soldier, who I have thus dubbed the "Bang Man," frustrates me with his limited linguistic abilities. Private Basilone has just informed me that his name is Private Theodore "BARAMANG". I believe it is crucial to maintain a watchful eye on the entire unit, including the Australian coloured soldiers.

I humbly request your support in assigning a capable intelligence officer to our camp, someone with expertise in espionage detection and counterintelligence. Their presence and diligent investigation could prove instrumental in unearthing any covert activities. Additionally, I propose a comprehensive review of all personnel files and background checks to ensure that every member of our camp is of unquestionable loyalty.

I remain steadfast in my dedication to our mission and the safety of our forces. I trust in your wisdom and guidance to address this matter with the utmost urgency. Together, we shall ensure the integrity and security of our camp as we face the challenges that lie ahead.

Yours faithfully,

Walter Denton Quartermaster Officer

Dear Sir,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to urgently bring to your attention the deteriorating situation here at Camp Camiguin. My previous letter regarding the suspected spy seems to have been disregarded, and I fear the consequences of inaction are beginning to unfold.

Since my last correspondence, I have noticed a significant increase in suspicious activities within the camp. Equipment that is crucial to our operations is being tampered with and sabotaged. It is becoming increasingly clear that we have a saboteur in our midst, and their intentions remain deeply unsettling. I cannot emphasize enough the urgency of the matter, as our combat readiness is being compromised.

Furthermore, I have observed a disconcerting atmosphere among the soldiers. It appears as if they have lost sight of the gravity of the war and are neglecting their responsibilities. The sense of purpose and determination that should accompany our duty has been replaced by an unsettling lethargy. It is as if the war itself has become non-existent to them, and their lackadaisical behavior is both concerning and perplexing.

I must admit, the pervasive nature of these incidents, coupled with the eerie atmosphere, has fueled my own paranoia. It feels as though we are surrounded by a cloud of secrecy and indifference. I implore you to take immediate action to address these issues before they escalate any further. Our mission, the lives of our fellow soldiers, and the success of our nation depend on it.

I request that a thorough investigation be conducted to identify the culprits responsible for the equipment sabotage. Additionally, it is crucial to reinforce discipline and instill a sense of purpose among the soldiers. We need to rekindle their commitment to the cause and remind them of the gravity of our situation.

I await your prompt response and guidance on how best to proceed. The safety and success of our mission hang in the balance, and it is vital that we address these concerns without delay.

Yours faithfully,

Walter Denton Quartermaster Officer

To the Despicable Traitor,

I can only assume that this letter, like all my previous attempts at communication, will find its way into your grimy hands. I am fully aware of your treacherous activities, and it sickens me to think that you have managed to infiltrate our ranks undetected. Your betrayal knows no bounds.

Cotton, I have unmasked your true identity, you conniving snake, most likely "Asa Koton", HA! How dare you pretend innocence while wreaking havoc within our camp? Your nights of sneaking around have not gone unnoticed, and your feeble excuses no longer fool me. You claimed it was a romantic tryst? Spare me your pathetic lies. Your rendezvous were nothing more than clandestine meetings with your Japanese handlers.

Tell me, Cotton, how did you manage to sabotage our artillery with such precision? How did you slip past our diligent watchmen? What devilish tools did you employ to tamper with the mechanisms, rendering our weaponry useless? I demand answers, though I have little hope of receiving them from a deceitful wretch like you.

You may think that intercepting my previous letters and reading my thoughts gives you an advantage. Well, let me assure you, I am onto you. Your every move, your every deception, is now laid bare before me. I know that you have been intercepting my messages, relishing in the fear and paranoia you instill.

So, listen closely, you spineless turncoat. Your days of sabotage and betrayal are numbered. The walls are closing in, and soon justice will be served. The punishment for treason is severe, and I eagerly await the moment when you face the consequences of your actions.

Know this Cotton, I will not rest until you are exposed and brought to justice. Every waking moment will be consumed by thoughts of your capture and the restoration of honor within our camp. Your web of deceit will crumble, and the truth will prevail.

Prepare yourself for the reckoning that awaits you, for your time is running out.
