### Lyrics

Wake up, you sleepy head  
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed  
Put another log on the fire for me  
I've made some breakfast and coffee  
Look out my window, what do I see?  
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me []
  
All the nightmares came today[]
And it looks as though they're here to stay  
  
What are we coming to?  
No room for me, no fun for you  
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones[]
Written in pain, written in awe []
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for[]
  
All the strangers came today[]
And it looks as though they're here to stay[]
  
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior[]

Look out at your children  
See their faces in golden rays[]
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race[]
The Earth is a bitch, we've finished our news 
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use[]
  
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay  
  
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior

The lyrics of "Oh! You Pretty Things" reflect the teachings of [Aleister Crowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley "Aleister Crowley") (left) and [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "Friedrich Nietzsche") (right)

The lyrics of "Oh! You Pretty Things" concern the establishment of a master race that will take over the world. Bowie had explored a similar premise in the 1967 track "We Are Hungry Men".[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerone200721-30) Like other tracks on _Hunky Dory_, particularly "[Quicksand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksand_(David_Bowie_song) "Quicksand (David Bowie song)")",[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDoggett2012145-31)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPegg2016218–219-32) the themes of "Oh! You Pretty Things" are dark, reflecting ideals of the occultist [Aleister Crowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley "Aleister Crowley") and his [Golden Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuckley200597-33) and philosopher [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "Friedrich Nietzsche") and his theory of _[Übermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch "Übermensch")_, or "Superman".[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDoggett2012114-34)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-mojo0702-35) Other songs Bowie had written during this period, including "[The Supermen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supermen "The Supermen")" from _The Man Who Sold the World_, reflect Nietzsche's theory of _Übermensch_.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDoggett201291-36) There is a "strong hint" of [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke")'s 1953 [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") novel _[Childhood's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood%27s_End "Childhood's End")_ and a direct reference to [Edward Bulwer-Lytton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bulwer-Lytton "Edward Bulwer-Lytton")'s 1871 novel _[The Coming Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vril "Vril")_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPegg2016202–204-13) Perone writes that the "pretty things" are not gender-specific, leading to possible [homosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality") interpretations.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerone200721-30)

In a January 1972 interview with [Melody Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Maker "Melody Maker") Bowie explains that "we have created a new kind of person in a way. We have created a child who will be so exposed to the media that he will be lost to his parents by age 12". He adds "all the things we can't do they will". In 1976 Bowie said "a lot of the songs do in fact deal with song kind of [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia "Schizophrenia"), or alternating [id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_(psychology) "Id (psychology)") problems, and 'Pretty Things' is one of them.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPegg2016167-37)

Carr and Murray state that the lyrics herald "the impending obsolescence of the human race in favour of an alliance between arriving aliens and the youth of the present society."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarrMurray198140–41-38) O'Leary states that the song contains "more acceptance than dread", with a blunt note being "the earth is a bitch". He comments on Bowie's indifferent delivery of the line "all the nightmares came today / And it looks as though they're here to stay", which he compares to [Black Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath "Black Sabbath"). In his analysis, the song praises the children that will replace us, but because they will suffer the same fate as us, there's no reason to fear the upcoming apocalypse.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Leary2015chap._5-4) Pegg cites [Biff Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biff_Rose "Biff Rose")'s 1968 song "Mama's Boy" from his _[The Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thorn_in_Mrs._Rose%27s_Side "The Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side")_ as a likely inspiration, stating that the lyric "But the kids are growing up as fine as can be / Members of a new society" "prefigures" the lyric for "Oh! You Pretty Things";[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPegg2016202–204-13) Bowie covered another song from that album, "Fill Your Heart", for _Hunky Dory_.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPegg201691–92-39) The darker themes provide a contrast to the music itself.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Pretty_Things#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDoggett2012114–115-40)
