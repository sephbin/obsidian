## Player Card
### Public Persona
You are a Nurse in the Australian Red Cross. You come from a well established farming family in South Australia and started training as a nurse when the war started. You spent some brief time tending to the wounded back in Australia, but have been positioned to the Pacific recently. You were engaged to a man named Elford Trenberth, who you barely knew before the war began. He died about 6 months ago as a prisoner of war.
### Private Persona
You belong to an various organisations, including "The Adelaide University Heretics Society" and "The Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained". Both organisations had arranged for you and Ethel Strigner (another Nurse) to be placed in the Pacific war effort so that you could collect biological samples from an obscure island in the Philippines.
There are puppet masters at hand that have conspired to put you where you are now. 
An island has been causing a fuss within the biological science communities, with a high frequency of new zoological species being discovered. Your scientific groups don't care much for the war, but still want access to new findings.

Recently you have fallen in reciprocal love with Ethel Stringer, a slightly more experience nurse and fellow "Science Heretic". This has brought about confusing and troubled thoughts, but you cannot change your feelings towards her.

It is best to keep both these things secret.
