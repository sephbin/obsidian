## Player Card
### Public Persona
You are a career Sergeant in the Australian army. Norman is a fairly simple man, stoic and loyal. He has a young family back in New South Wales, and has managed to stay out of too much trouble as a soldier during a world war. He had to bring most of the men through some skirmishes to finally settle at the current camp, with little to no casualties.
### Private Persona
With war, comes trauma, and you have recently caused it to yourself. A few months ago in the last skirmish Norman had with the Japanese forces, through negligence, he caused civilian casualties. It was painful to see the family mourning the death of their children, and their faces have been haunting his nightmares ever since. The men blamed the Japanese, but Captain Cotton, followed it up with Norman afterwards. For now, Norman is torn between owning up to it, but he feels that it will break him completely.

It is best to keep these things secret.
### Requirements
Norman is overweight, his abilities should be chosen to reflect this.
Norman must take the Soldier occupation.
Norman should take some form of sanity penalty when confronted with children or civilian casualties.


## Character Traits

Stoicism: Norman has developed a stoic demeanor over the years, keeping his emotions in check even in the most trying circumstances. This enables him to make tough decisions and maintain a level head amidst chaos. However, it also means he can sometimes appear distant or detached, struggling to express his own feelings.

Compassion: Beneath his hardened exterior, Norman carries a genuine compassion for others. He understands the sacrifices made by his fellow soldiers and does his best to support and uplift them. He lends a listening ear, offers a helping hand, and provides a sense of camaraderie that boosts morale in the face of adversity.

Stoic to a Fault: While Norman's stoic nature can be a positive trait, it can also hinder his emotional expression and empathy. He may struggle to connect with others on an emotional level or understand their feelings, which can create a sense of distance in his relationships.

## Relationships

### [[Arthur Cotton]]
"Arthur Cotton, our superior officer, has undergone a perplexing transformation recently. While he once embodied the epitome of military discipline and professionalism, he now exhibits a demeanor that is disconcertingly poetic and aloof. It's as if he has become detached from the grim realities of war, lost in a world of his own creation.

Arthur's newfound poetic sensibilities have raised eyebrows among the soldiers, myself included. He often engages in deep contemplation and philosophical discussions, delving into abstract notions and waxing poetic about the beauty of the world. While there is a certain allure to his words, I can't help but feel a growing concern.

In the midst of this brutal conflict, where lives are lost daily and the weight of responsibility rests heavily upon our shoulders, Arthur seems to have retreated into a realm of abstract thoughts and lofty ideals. His poetic musings and eloquent speeches, while captivating at times, leave me questioning his focus and ability to lead effectively.

Gone are the days when Arthur was grounded in the practical realities of military operations. He now appears more interested in deciphering the mysteries of the universe than in strategizing and ensuring the safety of our men. It is as if he has become enamored with the ethereal beauty of existence, losing touch with the grimness of our current predicament.

His aloofness is disconcerting, creating a rift between him and the soldiers under his command. We need a leader who can inspire confidence and instill a sense of purpose, someone who understands the harsh realities we face and can guide us through the darkness. But Arthur's preoccupation with poetic contemplation leaves us feeling adrift, searching for a firm hand to steady our course.

There are whispers among the ranks, questioning his commitment to the cause. Some see his poetic inclinations as a sign of weakness, an escape from the harshness of war. Others dismiss it as a temporary phase, hoping that he will soon regain his focus and steer us back on track.

As a stoic, I find myself at odds with Arthur's new persona. I value practicality and a clear-headed approach to challenges. I yearn for a leader who is firmly rooted in reality, capable of making tough decisions without losing sight of the bigger picture. The war demands a leader who can guide us with unwavering resolve, not someone who seems lost in the labyrinth of his own thoughts.

However, I must remember that appearances can be deceiving. Arthur's poetic nature might have hidden depths, a source of inspiration that I have yet to fully comprehend. Perhaps his musings hold a kernel of truth, a perspective that can illuminate our path through the darkness.

Only time will tell if Arthur's newfound poetic persona is a liability or an asset. In the meantime, I will strive to bridge the gap between his ethereal ponderings and the practicalities of war. Our survival depends on finding a way to reconcile his poetic soul with the harsh realities we face, for we are bound together in this perilous journey."

### [[Walter Denton]]
"Walter Denton, a fellow soldier in our ranks, is an intriguing character. As a quartermaster officer with a wealth of experience, Walter brings a sense of maturity and practicality to our daily operations. His advanced age compared to the rest of us lends him a certain wisdom and a weathered perspective on the intricacies of military logistics.

Walter's meticulous attention to detail and his proficiency in artillery operation and maintenance are commendable. He is a reliable asset to our team, ensuring that our equipment is in working order and our supplies are managed efficiently. Walter's commitment to his role is evident, and his expertise in the field commands respect.

However, there are times when Walter's suspicions and wariness manifest in ways that border on paranoia. His tendency to distrust certain individuals, particularly the Australian soldiers and the Aboriginal soldiers in our midst, can create tension within our already fragile camaraderie. While war demands vigilance and caution, Walter's deep-seated mistrust often feels excessive and unwarranted.

Nonetheless, I must acknowledge that Walter's apprehension may stem from his unwavering dedication to our mission and the desire to protect our troops. His vigilance could be seen as a necessary cautionary measure in a time where spies and infiltrators are a constant threat. Despite our differences in approach, I cannot deny the value he brings to our unit.

In many ways, Walter's presence acts as a balancing force in the camp. While some may view his suspicions as excessive, his insights and attention to detail have proven valuable on more than one occasion. His unwavering commitment to the cause serves as a reminder to us all of the seriousness of our mission.

Walter Denton is an enigmatic figure, a complex blend of experience, expertise, and a touch of paranoia. While I may not always see eye to eye with him, I respect his dedication and the unique perspective he brings to our team. In this crucible of war, we must find a way to bridge our differences and work together for the greater good."
