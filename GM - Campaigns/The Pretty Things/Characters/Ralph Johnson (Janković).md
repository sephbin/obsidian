## Player Card
### Public Persona
You are a young Officer in the Australian army. Ralph is an inspector, basically checking on logistics and making sure standards are kept. He comes from Melbourne and is single.
### Private Persona
You are more than just a logistics officer, you are a spy hunter. Ralph was a police detective before the war and has been recruited into the intelligence force, working indirectly for the US. They suspect there is a spy in this camp, and you've been sent to find out who.

It is possible the Ralph's heritage may come up in the game, his last name is recorded as Johnson, an immigrant translation of Janković. His family immigrated to Australia from Croatia before he was born. It may be irrelevant.

It is best to keep these things secret.
### Requirements
Ralph must take the Detective occupation. He should pick soldier related skills from his personal skill pool.

## Possible Character Traits

> Let's create a new character, Ralph Johnson. Ralph is an Australian military police officer in the Australian army during world war 2. Prior to the war, he was a police detective in Melbourne, and has been able to use his skill set investigating war crimes and seeking out spies. Ralph's parents immigrated to Australia as from Croatia, and changed their name from Janković to Johnson to fit in. Can you create a few distinct descriptions of Norman's personality. Include some positive and negative personality traits, but with the intent that Norman will be a protagonist, so he should be relatable.

2.  Sharp-minded: Ralph's background as a former police detective in Melbourne has honed his investigative skills and sharpened his mind. He has a keen eye for detail, a knack for noticing patterns, and an ability to connect seemingly unrelated pieces of information. His sharp mind allows him to unravel complex cases and uncover hidden truths.
    
3.  Cultural Sensitivity: Growing up with immigrant parents has instilled in Ralph a deep respect for diverse cultures and a heightened sense of cultural sensitivity.

### Negative
1.  Stubborn: Ralph's tenacious nature can sometimes manifest as stubbornness. Once he sets his mind on something, he can be resistant to changing his course or considering alternative viewpoints. This stubbornness can lead to clashes with others who have differing opinions or approaches.
    
2.  Distrustful: Due to his experiences investigating war crimes and seeking out spies, Ralph has developed a sense of deep distrust towards certain individuals. While this skepticism can be helpful in his line of work, it can also make it challenging for him to build trusting relationships or give others the benefit of the doubt.
    
3.  Blunt: Ralph's pragmatic nature can sometimes come across as overly blunt or direct. He doesn't sugarcoat his words and can be brutally honest, which may unintentionally hurt others' feelings or cause friction in interpersonal interactions.

4.  Workaholic: Ralph's relentless pursuit of justice and his commitment to his duty can make him prone to becoming a workaholic. He may struggle to find a healthy work-life balance, neglecting his personal well-being and relationships in favor of his professional responsibilities.
    
5.  Impatient: Ralph's drive for results and his goal-oriented mindset can make him impatient at times. He may become frustrated when progress is slow or when others don't meet his expectations. This impatience can lead to unnecessary tension or conflict, hindering effective teamwork or collaboration.
    
6.  Judgmental: Ralph's past experiences and investigative nature may make him prone to being judgmental. He may jump to conclusions or form opinions about people or situations without having all the facts. This inclination to pass judgment can hinder his ability to see the full picture or empathize with others' perspectives.
    
7.  Perfectionist: Ralph's high standards and attention to detail can sometimes turn into perfectionism. He may place excessive pressure on himself to achieve flawless results, which can lead to self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy. This perfectionistic tendency may also make it difficult for him to delegate tasks or accept help from others.


## Background Checks
After skimming through the background checks, you have a small synopsis on each of these people:
### Australians
[[Arthur Cotton]]
An older Australian lieutenant who has military control over the camp. Grew up in metropolitan Sydney prior to World War 1. His father (Tiberius Cotton) was a decorated war hero, but did not survive the war. His mother (Dorothy Cotton, nee York) was the daughter of a British ambassador. He relocated as a teenager to Canberra after the war and joined the army after coming of age. He has a wife (Mauve Cotton, nee Macquarie) and three children (Arthur Jr. Cotton-16, Victoria Cotton-10, and Henry Cotton-5) in Canberra  and has decent connections in the army and with local and federal government. He has submitted various poems to anthologies, most of which dwell on the phenomenal experiences of nature.

[[Grantly Tollis]]
An expert sergeant field engineer, who specialises in modern radio technology. Grew up in rural Queensland, on a sugar cane plantation. His father (John Tollis) and mother (Mauve Tollis. nee Price) owned the farm and Grantly was the middle of 8 children. He moved to Brisbane to study telecommunications and engineering, but failed due to poor literacy. He joined the army soon after and completed his practical education. He has no immediate family, other than his siblings and parents. He is a career soldier, spending most of his adult life slowly rising the ranks to sergeant. He barely passed the physical due to his large stature. Grantly wasn't originally sent to war in Europe because of his health, instead teaching younger soldiers how to maintain radio equipment on the field. He was eventually sent to assist the US during their campaign in the pacific. Grantly has been stationed at the camp to maintain the long distance radio relay, which covers the majority of Camiguin and several hundred kilometers north over the straight. There is little recorded on Grantly's personal interests.

[[Norman Bartholomew]] (Cody)
A career soldier, who is second in command to Lietenant Cotton in the camp. Grew up in Orange NSW, his father (Montgomery Bartholomew) was a RAAF pilot and widower stationed there. Norman was oldest of 5 boys, all who entered military service at coming of age. Norman has a young family in Wedderburn, NSW with his wife (Edith Bartholomew, nee Flynn) and his young daughter (Margaret Bartholomew-6). Norman has spent a long education in the military before the war, training as a field engineer and demolitions operator. He has several medals awarded to him, for defusing a bomb in the field.

[[Theo Baramangg]]
Barely understandable master marksman and tracker. There are no records to show this mans history other than that he signed up for the war in Queensland and that he can only speak "Aboriginie". Some records refer to him as a "Black Tracker" with super natural abilities.

[[Trevor Brown]]
A young Aboriginal soldier from Queensland, his name and age appears late, with no birth certificate. (Likely a part of the stolen generation). Little to no education other than within the white Australia schools, basically failed at integration in civil society, and joined the army once the war started.

### Americans
[[Walter Denton]]
An older logistics officer, should be retired. Grew up in Madison, Wisconsin (depending on how good my accent is), and eventually studied at the United States Military Academy (USMA), immediately joining the military as a young officer. He specialises in military logistics and artillery management and operation. Denton was part of the global dispatch team that distributed gas masks to soldiers during the phosgene attacks in "The Great War". He rarely saw combat during that war, but can be attributed to various ordinance developments and various logistical improvements. During WWII, he has only ever been assigned reserve positions; in part due to his skills and age. He has a wife (Gloria Denton, nee Forman), and several adult children (Jacob Denton-29, Maria Walford nee Denton-24, Tobias Denton-22, Victor Denton-20, Irving Denton-20) back in Madison. Walter has little to no other interests listed outside his success in logistics, but his children have had good academic success, included his oldest, who is an established professor at Harvard University. Gloria Denton is part of several art and culture societies in Madison, with several recorded expensive purchases of classical East Asian art, including sculptures, ink paintings and calligraphy.

[[Gordon Cash]] (Nick)
A younger private, only just recently joined the military. He has a dark past, orphaned prior to adolescence, his parents (John Cash, Helen Cash nee {Unrecorded}) were filed as dead after going missing. He was taken on as a ward by Alfred Pound, a dean at Harvard University, and possible friend of his parents, who saw through Gordon's education. Gordon started a law degree at Harvard, but dropped out to join the war. This happened very soon after Dean Alfred Pound passed away. Apart from his unfortunate upbringing, his background is unremarkable.

[[Anthony Basilone]]
A first generation Italian American, and young private, hailing from Little Italy, New York. His parents (Alonzo Basilone, Evelina Basilone nee {Unrecorded}) migrated from Ravenna Italy to the USA in 1909. He has far too many siblings to list here, his youngest of which passed away during the great depression. Anthony did not get a formal education, and his parents aren't listed as having a job. Agents have noted when looking for the family, there has been mention of a fruit stand, but it has been hard to get any more information of the family from the locals of Little Italy. Records show once Anthony joined the army, he is commonly referred to as "Tony". He barely passed the intellectual aptitude test to sign up.
