## Player Card
### Public Persona
You are a Soldier in the United States Army. You were orphaned as a teenager, but was adopted as a ward by a dean at the University of Havard. As you were starting your degree as a lawyer, Imperial Japan attacked the Pearl Habour, and it was your patriotic duty to put your education on hold to join the war effort.
### Private Persona
You are not an orphan, you are a spy. Your real name is Gordan Chevalier. Your merchant father has long been connected with Japan, a relationship which seems more political/ideological than business, and have been recruited into espionage for profit. Your backstory has been forged, with the right people, and strings have been pulled to make sure you aren't on the front, but near it. You have been sat in this boring camp for a while now, intercepting messages and sabotaging the artillery. You have received word that you will be moving on imminently, so you have been causing more issues that might not go unnoticed. 

There is a custom skill just for you called: Saboutage! If and when you want to make a roll for this and don't want it to be public, we need to agree upon a specific dice that you will use to signal that you are sabotaging rather than fixing/searching etc.

One final note, IF you don't want to be a spy, please let me know sooner than later. I will write the spy into an NPC and you will instead be someone looking for a spy.

It is best to keep these things secret.
