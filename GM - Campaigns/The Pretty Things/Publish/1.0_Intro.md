Missed Dues is a scenario set in 1922, for up to six players; with each player investigator coming from a criminal background. Nominally, the action takes place in Arkham; however, the location could easily be moved to any other large sized town or medium sized city of the Keeper’s choosing.
Six pre-generated investigators have been provided, although if the Keeper intends to use this scenario within an on going campaign, then ideally the investigators should have some form of relationship with the criminal world of Arkham, and perhaps owe Mordecai O’Leary a favor. The scenario assumes that the pre-generated investigators are being used.
The scenario is self-contained and does not require the Keeper to have a copy of H.P. Lovecraft’s Arkham by Chaosium, although use of this supplement may be advantageous.
While there are a number of potential combat encounters, the Keeper has the power to control such scenes in order to limit the danger to the investigators. It should be noted that the final scene can inflict dramatically large sanity losses and Keepers may wish to limit these if this scenario is being used as part of a campaign. However, if you intend to play Missed Dues as a one shot game with the pre-generated investigators, then feel free to let the dice fall where they may.
