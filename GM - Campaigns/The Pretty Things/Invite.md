Following that, players will choose 1 from 5 important characters that play a part in the following chapters. Player's will have freedom to build characters whithin the silhouette of that character and the role they will play. This will include fixed professions and identified max traits (for example, a character might be asked to have their highest trait be Dexterity).

**Archbishop Fulgencio Del Castillo**: A spanish exorcist of the Catholic church
**Cardinal Mino Fiorensi**: An italian cardinal and scientist, appointed "Devil's Advocate" of the Catholic church
**Gonzalo Donoso Cortés**: A young spanish missionary based in the Philippines
**Capt. Emilio Pavía y Savignore**: A merchant captain and donor to the Catholic church
