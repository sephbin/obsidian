What is Lysaght Trimdek - Night Sky made from

ChatGPT

As of my last update in September 2021, Lysaght Trimdek is a brand of roofing and wall cladding made by Lysaght, a well-known Australian steel building products manufacturer. "Night Sky" is a specific color option available for the Lysaght Trimdek product line.

Lysaght Trimdek roofing and wall cladding are typically made from high-quality steel, specifically Colorbond® steel. Colorbond® steel is a coated steel product known for its durability, weather resistance, and aesthetic appeal. It is made from a combination of steel, zinc, and aluminum, which is then coated with a special paint system that provides color and additional protection against corrosion.

The specific composition and manufacturing process of Colorbond® steel may vary slightly based on the region and local standards, so it's always a good idea to check with the manufacturer or their official documentation for the most up-to-date information.

If you are inquiring about a more recent version of Lysaght Trimdek or any changes made to the product after September 2021, I recommend reaching out to Lysaght directly or visiting their official website for the most current information.
