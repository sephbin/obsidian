This document is a split from the Door Schedule (SMCSWSPS-COX-OSN-AT-SCH-910100) because the Facade doors and the Internal doors are likely to require milestone issues at different times, and are coordinated with different contractors. The Door Schedule will still include the door numbers for the facade, but will not contain any duplicate information in the Facade Door Schedule, rather just give reference to check the Facade Door Schedule. We have maintained the revision number, starting at G9, as doors are tracked with revisions. We advise the drawing's revision number should be the same as any changed doors. Secondary to that, if we were to revert to G1, then doors are guaranteed to have duplicate revision numbers in the history of the schedules, which we want to avoid. Can you rewrite this to sound professional

This document serves as a supplementary schedule to the Door Schedule (SMCSWSPS-COX-OSN-AT-SCH-910100) as it pertains specifically to facade doors and internal doors. These types of doors may require different milestones and coordination with different contractors. The Door Schedule will continue to include door numbers for facade doors, but will not duplicate any information found in this Facade Door Schedule. To maintain consistency and accuracy, the revision number for this schedule will remain at G9, as doors are tracked with revisions. It is also recommended that any changes made to the doors are reflected in the revision number of the associated drawings. In order to avoid confusion and duplication, it is important to ensure that the revision numbers for doors do not overlap with previous versions.
