### Extra Features
#### wreath of blades
1/day 1D4 / 2 levels
Keen 1d6
Nulifying - Spell Resisitance
Negating - Damage Resisitance 

#### super strong dude
strength check +20 Ignore Hardness for objects and constructs Charge Objects and Walls

#### Grave Digger's Shovel
Aura strong transmutation CL 20th Slot none; Price —; Weight 5 lbs. 

##### Description
This large black shovel looks like it has seen much use. The wooden haft is worn and smooth, the blade is scratched and notched and streaked with grave dirt. Imbued with devastating magic from Pharasma's Court, the Grave Digger's Shovel may be used three times per day to target a creature or object with a mage’s disjunction. Activating this ability requires the user to make a successful attack against the target.
A Grave Digger's Shovel can be used as an improvised weapon in combat—when so utilized, it has a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, deals 1d8 points of slashing damage on a hit, and automatically bypasses any damage reduction (including DR/epic or DR/—).
- Transmute Rock to Mud (Sp) Three times per day, you can use this spell-like ability by striking rock and affecting a 40 foot cube. • Circle of Dust - Once per day when driven into the ground, it casts Undeath to Death (DC 10+half Level+CHA) centred on the shovel
- Disrupting Strike (Su) Three times per day, you can channel disruptive energy through your weapon against an undead creature or evil outsider. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. If your attack hits an undead creature or evil outsider, you deal an extra 6d6 points of damage. If your attack misses or your target was not an undead or evil outsider, the use of the ability is wasted.
#### Crimson assassin
At 8th level, as an immediate action a number of times per day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1), the Crimson assassin can become ethereal for an instant as she is attacked by a weapon or is forced to attempt a Reflex saving throw. She must choose to activate this ability before the weapon’s attack roll or the spell’s effects are adjudicated. This grants the Crimson assassin a 50% chance to avoid taking damage from the attack or effect.

#### Mythic Features
##### Sudden Block (Su)

As an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder a melee attack made against you or an adjacent ally. Add your tier to your AC or the ally’s AC against this attack. The creature making the attack must make two [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) and take the lower result. Once the attack is resolved, you or your ally (your choice) can make one melee attack against the creature. The damage from this attack bypasses all [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction).

##### Adamantine Mind (Ex)

Your mind is as hard as any [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), and is dangerous to engage. You gain a bonus equal to your tier on saving throws against [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effects. Whenever you succeed at a save against a [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effect, the creature attacking you with that effect must succeed at a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save (at the same DC) or be [stunned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned) for 1 round.

##### Retributive Reach (Ex)

Treat your reach as 5 feet greater than normal for the purpose of determining whether or not you can make an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). If a creature provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) within this area of increased reach, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus equal to your tier on the [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) and damage roll of the attack of opportunity.

##### Draw Fire (Su)

As an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), when an ally within 30 feet is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, you can have that attack target you instead. If you would normally be out of range for that attack, the attack is able to hit you as if you were at maximum range. You can use this ability without using an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions) by expending one use of mythic power.


##### Turn the Tables (Ex)

If a creature fails a [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check made against you, as an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions) you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt that same maneuver against that creature. You receive a +10 bonus on this [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check.


#### Legendary Item
You gain a legendary item. This item grants a number of abilities equal to your tier (maximum 3). At 3rd tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to six abilities and causing the item to become a lesser artifact. At 6th tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to 10 abilities; the item then becomes a greater artifact.
##### The Loathing Razer Blade (Major Artifact)
**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 16th; **Slot** none; **Price** —; **Weight** 10 lbs.
**Alignment** NE; **Ego** ??; **Senses** 30 ft. (vision and hearing); **Int** 14, **Wis** 12, **Cha** 10; **Communication** speech (Common, one additional); **Powers** it can cast ??? and ??? and ??? 3 times a day
This simple metal razer blade functions similarly to a _+5 vicious treasonous bane improvised dagger_. Instead of the normal benefit of treasonous and bane, the user can reatune these abilities to their sworn enemy. This attunement cannot be changed willfully, it is set by a seething hatred within the wielder. If the wielder doesn't feel hatred towards anyone, the intilligent stentience of the razer will attempt to plant seeds of hatred and loathing within the wielder.
The razer is treated as an improvised weapon for all intents and purposes, and can shapechange into objects that would also be considered improvised weapon. It could disguise itself as a broom or a crowbar, but not a sword or a bow.
Additionally, whenever _the Loathing Razer Blade_ strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take an additional 5d4 points of force damage. If the blade scores a critical hit, it explodes flurry of shrapnel centered on the wielder’s opponent. All creatures within the explosions 20-foot-radius spread—including _Loathing Razer Blade’s_ wielder and allies, if within range—take 10d4 points of force damage (DC 25 Reflex for half). The wielder has no control over the artifacts’s eruption and cannot prevent it from exploding.

7. Upgradable

A _treasonous_ weapon functions as a [patriotic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/patriotic) weapon, but when wielded against a member of the nationality to which it is attuned, the weapon’s [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) is +2 better than its actual bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against members of the designated nationality. This extra damage is not multiplied on a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits).
