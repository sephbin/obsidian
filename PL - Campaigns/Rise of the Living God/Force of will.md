As anÂ [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), you can expend one use of mythic power to reroll a d20 roll you just made, or force any non-mythic creature to reroll a d20 roll it just made. You can use this ability after the results are revealed. Whoever rerolls a roll must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower.
