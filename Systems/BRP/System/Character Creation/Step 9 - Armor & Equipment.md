character’s home environment and the setting of the campaign.
M An amount of pocket money and personal savings based on your
character’s wealth level.

but having some emotional connection.
M Any trade tools or equipment suitable to your character’s profession.
M Any weapon that your character has a skill of over 50% in, if appropriate.
M Based on the setting and the campaign, your character’s profession,

vehicle such as a horse, wagon, bicycle, automobile, personal flier,
small space transport, or some other means of transportation. This
is subject to the gamemaster’s approval.
M No specific rules for finances are provided; the suggested wealth for
professions and the Status skill are the best guidelines for determining
what items and monies your character begins play owning or having
access to. The gamemaster should be able to help you describe this in an
appropriate level of detail, and may have additional restrictions based on
the requirements of the campaign and/or setting.
