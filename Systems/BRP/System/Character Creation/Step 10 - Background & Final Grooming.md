If you couldn’t think of a name beforehand in Step One, now is the time to
name your character. It is also a good time to fill in all of the blank spaces that
describe your character, mentally and physically, and come up with some
ideas about his or her background.
In Step Eight you determined your character’s distinctive features, so you
should decide whether your character has other less distinctive features.
What colors are hair, skin, and their eyes? How does he or she dress? Any
interesting mannerisms, or motto or saying? An interesting reputation?
Where is your character from? Where did he go to school (if at all)? What is
her relation with family? Any significant organizations? An interesting past?
Significant religious or political beliefs?
The back of the character sheet has places for additional descriptive or
background elements. Fill out as many or as few of these as you’d like, and
check with the gamemaster to make sure that he or she knows about them
and that they’re suitable for the game.
