You can describe a nonplayer character’s personality numerically, just like a skill or passion (page 214). An easy method to do this is a personality trait scale, where a trait is described as a percentile value of 0 to 100. A value of 0 indicates that the personality trait is nonexistent, and a 100 is always representative of that character.
Personality traits are paired with an opposite, such as Aggressive vs. Passive, and the value of the opposite trait is equal to 100 minus the initial personality trait. A quick means of shorthand for this pairing is ‘Aggressive 90 | 10 Passive’, for example. Someone with 50 | 50 in a trait the Personality Traits sheet below helps make this easy to keep track of these traits for nonplayer characters. You can use some, many, or all these to define your nonplayer characters.

###### Personality Traits

|Impulsive|    \|   |Cautious|

|Greedy|       \|   |Generous|
|Energetic|    \|   |Lazy|
|Honorable|    \|   |Dishonorable|
|Brave|        \|   |Cowardly|
|Curious|      \|   |Incurious|
|Dependable|   \|   |Unreliable|
|Pious|        \|   |Irreligious|

For example, a nonplayer character is highly aggressive, with a value of 90 on their Aggressive personality trait. The opposing trait is Passive and thus has a value of 10 (100–90=10). A nonplayer character with an Aggressive 90 is ready to pick a fight, answers any challenge, and usually escalates to violence, while someone with Passive 90 usually backs down from conflicts and avoids any direct confrontations.

You do not need to determine all the personality traits for your significant nonplayer characters. Instead, choose one or a few relevant ones and assign values to them. You don’t even need to determine the opposing trait’s value, as it’s apparent. Assign values as desired or pick relevant ones and divide a D100 roll by 2 and add 50 to the result, for a spread of 51–100. Or roll 3D10+70 for extreme cases.
Personality traits can guide your roleplaying of the nonplayer character by simply looking at the value, or you can roll to see how the nonplayer character behaves. Success with one trait means they act on that character trait, while failure means that the opposite trait is followed. You may also choose to utilize special or critical results for these rolls, but only in a general sense.
For example, the characters meet the nonplayer character with the ‘Aggressive 90 | 10 Passive’ personality trait spread, and one of them behaves rudely to the nonplayer character. You know from the spread how they’re likely to react, but you decide to roll, just to see what happens. Any roll of 01–90 and the nonplayer character reacts aggressively, while a roll of 91–100 indicates a passive response. Perhaps they’re distracted or unwilling at this time to get into it with the characters?
#### Skills and Personality Traits
The Insight skill may be used to quickly determine a nonplayer characters personality trait spread in a general sense, or Psychology might be used for long-term analysis. Don’t reveal the actual values, but rather a particular strongly lean in one direction or the other.
Though it is extremely unlikely to have a player character performing Psychology on a nonplayer character for an extended period, you may allow a successful Psychology roll to affect a single paired personality trait in the same fashion that it restores lost SAN. Roll to see whether SAN points are restored, but instead of adding SAN, instead use the result to shift a particular personality trait by that many points in the desired direction. Treatment time is identical. This way, through patience and therapy, a successful Psychology roll can ‘help’ a nonplayer character change their natural inclinations towards a desired personality trait.
#### Personality Traits and Player Characters
You can also use personality traits for player characters, if desired, treating them as you would for nonplayer characters. They become like passions (page 214), augmenting activities or being consulted when provoked, with experience checks if successful. The player always has control over what their character does, but if they make a successful roll on one trait and decide to act according to the opposing trait, you should have them automatically make an experience check for that opposite trait. When one trait increases, the other is decreased. If they wish to seek treatment for this trait, see the rules for Psychology (above).
