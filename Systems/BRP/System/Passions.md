Adventures are often full of intense emotion, which can lead to heights of heroism and depths of tragedy. These are defined as passions, distinct emotional connections to various entities, groups, places, or even oneself. Love, Hate, Fear, Devotion, and Loyalty are often placed in terrible conflict with one another, as well as challenging personal codes of honor. These are rated like skills and rolled on D100, allowing the character to become inspired, their actions charged by their beliefs. Inspired characters are more able to overcome challenges with superhuman effort and a likelihood of success. Failing such a roll may lead to despair or depression.
Like skills, passions increase through successful use with experience, and some of them can be reduced through actions contrary to the passion. Players always control their characters’ behaviors: passions merely inform how the character is feeling about the subject, no matter how differently they act.
### Basic Passions
The most common passions are described here, though this list is not exhaustive. Like a skill specialty, a parenthesis after a passion indicates that a suitable focus must be chosen. 
#### Devotion (deity)
Devotion to a god or divine force represents a personal devotion of one’s life to a deity or some divine force or entity. This indicates a sincere emotional dedication and strong faith. When used for inspiration, that faith manifests within the character, imbuing them with some small measure of courage.
#### Fear (type or individual)
Fear is perhaps one of the strongest passions, driving all manner of behavior, for better or worse. Fear can cause an individual to flee from the subject or act irrationally to escape its presence, or it can even cause an adverse reaction.
Common Fears can be focused on a particular group or an individual, such as a former enemy or treacherous relative. Fear cannot be defined towards general concepts or forces, such as ‘old age’ or ‘earthquakes’, and is generally not useful when the subject is something any reasonable being would fear, like death.
To inspire the character, the subject of the Fear must either be present, or their presence imminent. One cannot by motivated by Fear subject is hundreds of kilometers away and shows no sign of arrival. The threat of confronting the subject must be real and immediate.
The resulting behavior from being inspired by Fear can be to aid some form of avoidance, flight, or defense from the subject, or even to spur violent opposition when cornered. At times, though, the gamemaster may ask the player to roll for their Fear passion if the character is embarking on a course of action that would put them into contact with the source of fear.
#### Hate (group or individual)
Hatred unfortunately motivates many people, whether through racism, bigotry, or based on a particular hatred for a past wrong, real or imagined.
When used for inspiration, Hatred can only be used against a specific subject or type of subjects and does not apply to those allied with the subject of the hatred. Hates can also be aimed at specific people, usually for specific personal reasons.
#### Honor
Honor is a martial virtue, a personal code of dignity, integrity, and pride. Personal honor is not a slippery issue, subject to interpretation. The difference between honorable action and dishonorable action is clear to everyone, no matter how they behave. The Dishonor table lists things that most people agree are dishonorable actions for an average person. Performing these deeds diminishes honor.
###### Dishonor
|Dishonorable Act|Honor Lost|
|-|-|
|Attacking an unarmed foe|–5%|
|Cowardice|–5%|
|Desertion from battle|–5%|
|Refusing to offer mercy when it is deserved|–5%|
|Plundering a holy place of your religion|–5%|
|Discourtesy to someone under your protection|–10%|
|Flagrant cowardice|–15%|
|Treason against your allies|–15%|
|Breaking an oath|–25%|
|Attacking or stealing from the weak|–25%|
|Killing someone weaker than oneself|–35%|
|Rape or sexual assault|–50%|
|Killing family members|–50%|

Honor is specific to the character and does not include other social obligations. One’s Honor is not abused if someone insults their family—Love (family) covers that. Likewise, someone insulting one’s god should consult the Devotion (deity) or Loyalty (temple) Passion, not Honor.
Honor can include almost anything that a character chooses it to, and their own individual code of honor should be developed when this passion is taken. Someone with an extremely high Honor may be offended by anything that anyone says that could be construed as an insult, while a character with low or no Honor may not care what is said of them.

#### Love
Love is an emotional bond or attraction felt by one individual for another individual or group. A character may have many loves.
- Love (family) is a natural emotion common to humankind in any age or culture. One’s close family is often the first and most important community one belongs to. Family members are expected to support, protect, and avenge each other.
- Love (individual) indicates a deep feeling and attraction for another person. It usually implies physical and carnal commitment, although it may also include unrequited love.
#### Loyalty (group or place)
Loyalty is the cornerstone of all of society beyond the family. It is the social bond which members of a community feel for each other. With it, one can call upon that community for support.
A character with conflicting loyalties may use their respective Loyalty ratings to determine an appropriate course of action. The player can choose based on the higher Loyalty rating or test them as an opposed roll. Thus, a player can use an opposed roll to determine if their character will obey their hometown loyalty or to an individual if those loyalties are in conflict.
- Loyalty (community) is the measure of the bond a character has with their culture. It typically includes an obligation to avenge slights or injuries against that community or its members. Loyalty (community) is used to gain the support of the community in question.
- Loyalty (location) is the measure of one’s willingness to live, fight, and die for a location they feel immense attachment to. This can be a hometown, a city, or even a country.
- Loyalty (individual) is the measure of a character’s bond to specific individual, such as ruler, boss, or another patron. A warrior owes personal loyalty to their leader; in return, the leader rewards their followers with compensation, support, or other privileges. Loyalty (individual) is also used to gain the personal support of that individual.
Other passions may exist, such as Distrust (individual or group), Respect (individual or group), or Greed, which works like Honor and can spur avaricious behavior. You can work with your players to devise other passions, as desired, but if personality traits are being used, be careful not to overlap too much with those.
### Starting Passions
The easiest way to determine starting passions is to let the players define them. When characters are created, let each player pick three passions their character starts with one passion at 80% and two at 60%. If desired, passions can be assigned or modified based on the character’s culture or place of origin.
### Using Passions
Passions define a character’s life intentions and serve to inspire them. The gamemaster may call for a passion roll. At other times, the player may suggest and request one, with the gamemaster’s approval. Here are some of the ways that passions can affect play.
#### Roleplaying Guidelines
At their most basic, a passion is a numerical rating of the degree of intensity a character feels for the subject of the passion, and can be used by the player when there is a question of how the character would act. The higher the passion, the more likely the character is going to act on it. The lower a passion, the more the character can ignore it.
Players always have control over their characters, but passion rolls can be used when a clear course of action is not obvious, or when the gamemaster thinks the character is behaving drastically ‘out of character’. While the player is still in charge, the gamemaster might portray going against a passion (rolled or a high score) with comments like “Your character has a bad feeling about this but pushes on” or something to that effect.
#### Demonstration and Support
A character with Loyalty might be called upon to roll it convincing someone else that they both share the same fealty. Trying to demonstrate one’s Devotion, Hatred, Love, or Loyalty to sway others and be a good example are great ways to use passions in play. Succeed, and mutual support and aid may be offered; fail and the character may be turned away as a poseur and fraud.
#### Inspiration
A character may attempt to be inspired by their passion and request a roll to augment a skill, with the gamemaster’s approval. Only one attempt at inspiration can be made in a situation or ‘scene’—such as the duration of a fight, social gathering, an action sequence, etc. The character does not get to make an inspiration roll every time the same action is attempted. The inspiration lasts for the time it takes to complete the activity, such as the duration of the combat or battle (with a maximum duration of one day). If in doubt, the gamemaster determines the duration of the inspiration. It does not take any time to attempt an inspiration based on a passion—they can happen as part of another action.
The gamemaster has the final say on whether a passion roll for inspiration can be attempted. Players are warned that passion rolls can be extremely risky as well as rewarding: a fumbled passion roll results in despair! If the character has already rolled to be inspired by a passion during the situation at hand, they cannot try to be inspired again, even by a different passion. Additionally, the bonus from inspiration cannot be combined with an augment from another skill. (page 38)
Remember that the gamemaster has the final say on the appropriateness of attempting Inspiration and its duration. The player must roll against the passion’s rating on a D100:
- Critical Success: One chosen skill temporarily receives a +50% bonus for the duration of the task or situation An experience check is gained in the passion.
- Special Success: One chosen skill temporarily receives a +30% bonus for the duration of the task or situation. An experience check is gained in the passion.
- Success: One chosen skill temporarily receives a +20% bonus for the duration of the task or situation. An experience check is gained in the passion.
- Failure: The character is despondent, modifying all further rolls made in the situation or scene by –10%. This penalty ends with the next scene.
- Fumble: The passion is immediately modified by –1D10% and the character is overcome by despair (see the Despair table, following). For the duration of the despair, the character is effectively incapable of doing anything more than running away or hiding, though the gamemaster may allow some degree of action beyond this in the right circumstances.
###### Despair
| Result | Duration of Despair |
|-|-|
|1-3|1D10 combat rounds|
|4-7|4D10+10 combat rounds|
|8-9|Until sunset, sunrise, or similar length of time|
|10| 1D3 game days|

If a passion is ever reduced to 0%, removed it from the character sheet. A passion cannot go below 0. Additionally, the character can never regain a passion that has been lost in this fashion: it has been exhausted and cannot be renewed unless the gamemaster determines that an extraordinary set of circumstances or behavior merits its return.
### Mandatory Rolls
Passions at 80% or higher represent staunchly held beliefs and connections and are not to be taken lightly or used only when convenient. Such extreme passions can require the player to make mandatory rolls due to these beliefs, if the gamemaster chooses. In general, the gamemaster has several options if the player has their character do something inappropriate for their rating in a relevant passion, such as a character with Hate (Nazis) 95% letting some Nazis go after a fight.
- Reduce the passion to below 80%.
- Oppose the passion with another passion as an opposed roll. If the opposed ability wins the contest with the Rune or passion, the player can act in a different manner without modifying the primary passion. In this case, the conflicting passion won out.
### Gaining a Passion
Passions may easily be gained during play. Characters should get many opportunities to gain enemies, loved ones, allies, and loyalties. Both the player and gamemaster should agree upon introducing a new passion. When something significant occurs to the character, the gamemaster or player may suggest that a passion has been generated. Generally, the starting value is 60%, but might be higher based on circumstances.
### Voluntarily Reducing a Passion
A character with a passion 80% or higher who performs an action that directly contradicts that passion may either simply lower the passion to 80% (or lower) or try to oppose that passion with another one. However, the character may wish to reduce a passion in the following manner:
- When experience is determined, pick a passion to be lowered. If has an experience check, it cannot be lowered at this time. If it has not been tested and the player wishes to lower it, roll as if checking for experience. If the experience roll is unsuccessful, reduce the passion by –1D6.
- A passion 50% or lower can be largely ignored in play, as it represents ambivalence about the subject. It can be removed from the character sheet, as desired.
