Many settings include belief in higher powers. These could be gods, angels, saints, devils, divine principles, or even abstract philosophical concepts.
A character who consistently behaves according to their beliefs has an allegiance to it, measured with the allegiance score. Acting or behaving as favored by one’s deity (or deities) can earn allegiance points that indicate dedication. Allegiance can change during in play and new allegiances can appear as new forces become important.
Characters may earn allegiance points from more than one entity or god. People don’t always behave consistently from one day to the next, and even the most moral and ethical person can commit acts of incredible evil. The system of allegiance allows a character to have allegiance scores towards opposed or multiple forces.
When one allegiance score is 20+ points higher than any other allegiance score, the character is considered allied with that force, and may achieve certain benefits because of that allegiance. The character must consciously acknowledge this allegiance however, regardless of the score.
While an allegiance may seem obvious, they do not enjoy its benefits if they do not acknowledge it.
Allegiance points are almost never lost. They are always positive or 0. If reduced, they cannot go below 0. Allegiance points are a reward for behavior of one type or another, thus having multiple (or at least opposed) forces is ideal. Behavior that would be punished in one belief system is often rewarded in another, so that the character is not being penalized points by acting against the divine force they favor, but is instead being awarded points by the force that opposes their favored allegiance.
As an allied character gains higher levels of allegiance, they may attain status within the associated cult or church (if any), represented in titles, powers, or responsibilities.
#### Starting Allegiance
If allegiance is used, roll 1D6–2 (minimum 0) a number of times equal to the number of available allegiances to represent allegiance points earned prior to the beginning of the game. The gamemaster can choose one of the following for the player to do:
- Assign allegiance totals in the order they’re rolled.
- Assign allegiance scores as desired.
For each (if any) power type tied to any spiritual force, add +1 point to each appropriate allegiance. Similarly, add +1 for each mutation for an appropriate allegiance. Characters of the occultist, priest, or shaman professions add allegiance points equal to ½ POW (round up) distributed as desired.
#### Increasing Allegiance
Actions that favor the allegiance increase the character’s allegiance score.
See Creating Allegiances (page 212) for a list of potential actions that may grant allegiance points. After an adventure, provided that the character has behaved in a manner favored by the force, ask the player to perform an allegiance test. This is identical to an experience check (see Skill Improvement, page 118). If successful, the character’s allegiance score increases by +1D6 points.
If the character has performed actions encouraged by multiple allegiances, call for experience tests for all allegiances that apply, each gaining +1D6 points if successful.
#### Multiple Allegiances
No matter what guidelines are favored by their allegiance, every character has free will and can act as desired. A character can have scores in all, some, or none of the available allegiances. However, the character’s alliance is only with the highest of the scores if that score is 20+ points higher than the next highest, and then only if the character acknowledges the allegiance.
#### Maintaining Allegiance
When an allied character acts contrary to the interests of their allegiance, you may require the player to succeed in roll of D100 to test that allegiance.
If the roll is above the character’s current allegiance score, you should increase the character’s opposed allegiance score by an amount equal to 1D4 through 1D8, depending on the degree of the aberrant behavior.
If the roll is equal to or less than the character’s current allegiance score, there is no consequence.
If the character has an allegiance score of 100+ and has made commitment to that cause, you should warn the player that any actions taken against that allegiance are at the character’s peril. A character with a strong allegiance may lose the benefits of the allegiance and be considered an enemy to fellow believers. There may be a divine or karmic punishment inflicted, or they may have to undertake penance to see their benefits reinstated.
Penance might be fasting and prolonged meditation, a quest, an act of contrition, a sacrifice of some sort, or a ritual of purification.
#### Creating Allegiances
You should define the allegiances and establish what each stands for. It is best to have at least two forces vying for a player character’s allegiance, to emphasize the struggle between one course of belief vs. another.
The next step is to determine how many allegiance points are awarded for various actions. The easiest way to do this is to create a checklist of actions likely to occur in the game and decide which force awards allegiance points to each action. Following are some suitable actions:
- Aiding someone weaker than yourself
- Behaving dishonorably
- Behaving honorably
- Charity towards the weak or destitute
- Creating something to honor your allied force
- Destroying a supernatural being
- Destroying something sacred to another force
- Freeing someone from imprisonment
- Invoking your allied force disrespectfully
- Invoking your allied force with respect
- Killing someone in cold blood (murder)
- Killing someone in self-defense
- Major service to your allegiance
- Minor service to your allegiance
- Protecting someone
- Saving someone’s life
- Theft
For each action, it is suggested that you list the allegiance reward for an opposed action, such as ‘Aiding someone weaker than yourself ’ might be opposed by ‘Exploiting someone weaker than yourself ’. Major actions are worth 3 points of allegiance, significant ones worth 2, and minor ones worth 1 point.
After this, you must decide whether allegiance offers any particular rewards or whether the allegiance points will merely be a measure of devotion to that force. These can be drawn from Benefits of Allegiance (following) or can be more specific to the nature of the divine force.
When the character reaches 100+ with a specific allegiance they may be considered to have become an apotheosis of the allegiance (page 213), a paragon of that divine force’s will in the world.
A campaign incorporating Christian theology would have Heaven and Hell as the two opposed allegiances, with the highest allegiance being a strong indicator as to where the character will go when they die. A campaign setting with a pantheon of gods lets the character have allegiance to multiple gods.
Allegiance does not necessarily have to be tied to divine beings from fantasy worlds, or even religions. In a science fiction setting, allegiance could be to something as abstract as a mystical force binding all living things together, with opposed bright and shadowy sides. Allegiance in a superhero setting could be towards Law or Anarchy, or Right and Wrong. Superheroes allegiance by defeating evildoers and saving the innocent, while super villains are rewarded by committing crime and escaping justice.
#### Benefits to Allegiance
Decide whether there are any real benefits to allegiance, and what those are. If one allegiance grants a benefit, the others should offer equivalent benefits, such as any of the following:
- Once the character’s power points are expended, they may, upon a successful allegiance roll, instantly gain up to 1/10 (10%) of their current allegiance score (round up) as an extra reserve of power points. The allegiance points do not change with this benefit.
These points must be drawn as the character’s last power points are spent, otherwise they will fall unconscious. The points are otherwise identical to normal power points. This can be attempted up to three times during a game session. If using this ability, the character can make an allegiance test at the end of the adventure.
With a successful allegiance roll, the character can use up to 1/5 (20%), rounded up, of their current allegiance score as temporary hit points, once per game session. The allegiance points do not change. These hit points are expended before the character’s normal hit points and are not regenerated or restored in any way if lost. At the end of the session, any hit points over the character’s regular hit point total disappear. If the character uses these extra hit points, they can make an allegiance test at the end of the adventure.
- With a successful allegiance roll, the character can create a pool equal to their entire current allegiance score as a reservoir of extra skill points that can be added to existing skill ratings for specific rolls.
This can be done up to three times per session. Allegiance points do not change with this benefit. The player can choose which skills to add these points to, and how many points to add. The increases to these skill points must be declared before rolling, and the adjusted numbers are utilized if determining special successes, etc. These points can only be used for skill checks, and not resistance rolls, characteristic rolls, allegiance rolls, experience rolls, etc. A successful skill roll using these points is not eligible for an experience check.
After using these extra skill points, , they can make an allegiance test at the end of the adventure.
- Any character who is allied to a power (20+ more than the second highest allegiance) can call for divine intervention. The chance of success is equal to that of a critical success. If a critical success is rolled, the power intervenes in some fashion, whether directly, through an agent or proxy, or through some clearly miraculous manifestation of the natural world. Generally, most deities have virtually unlimited power, so this aid can be extraordinary. The character can make an allegiance test at the end of the adventure.
Similar benefits might be created to provide fatigue points, Sanity points, or even allow for divine inspiration in the form of Idea rolls.
#### Apotheosis
As noted above, if the character reaches a total of 100+ with an allegiance and is allied with that allegiance, they may be asked in a vision (or some other divine message) to serve it, to become its apotheosis. Scores in other allegiances do not matter. Apotheosis is not automatic. The character must demonstrate through their faith and actions that this is warranted.
If the offer is accepted, an apotheosis occurs, changing the character into a living avatar and steadfast champion of the force.
Benefits to allegiance continue to accrue. The character maintains free will and can even betray the force they serve. If the character refuses apotheosis, their allegiance points continue to increase normally until death or retirement.
Accepting apotheosis may confer one or more significant benefits to the character. You are encouraged to craft suitable rewards and benefits.
Following are examples of what apotheosis might bestow:
- Achieving some monumental personal goal, such as meeting their one true love, or finding a spiritual retreat where it is possible to achieve perfect happiness and escape from the turmoil of the world. This could even end tragically, as well, with the character achieving an epic destiny where the only suitable outcome is death.
- A limited immortality where the body does not age normally or suffer from disease or other afflictions. The character’s healing rate does not change and they can still be slain by weapons or other injury.
Twisted gods may choose to make this immortal body a mixed blessing, such as hideous scarring, endless pain, or some supernatural marking that cannot be removed.
- An increase of permanent hit points to CON+SIZ (or simply doubling current hit points). If hit locations are used (page 21), these are also adjusted accordingly. If total hit points (page 20) are used, double them.
- Double the skill ratings of any three skills of the player’s choice, suitable to the nature of the allegiance.
- A weapon, item, or significant artifact is provided through divine means, either as the result of a quest or some other means of gaining it. This item is incredibly powerful and recognizable by any who share or opposed to the character’s allegiance.
- Being consumed entirely by the divine force and reborn as its living avatar, losing or gaining characteristic points as appropriate, with maximum power points doubling (though the POW characteristic remains unchanged). The character may even become a divine being akin to an angel (page 233) or demon (page 234).
At this point, the player character has a POW×3 chance of initiating direct and immediate communication with the force. The force dominates the character’s life, communicating with them frequently and directly.
This may even become a hindrance; with the force interfering in actions that do not further its will.
