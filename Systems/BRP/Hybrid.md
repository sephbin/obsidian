Such a mutant is a generic hybrid with the traits of two or more
different types of animals. They might have lobster-like claws, a tiger
head, or anything else imaginable. As a minor mutation, the mutant
has a few defining elements clearly marking them as a hybrid, and as
a major mutation, they are more animal than human, and may find it
impossible to blend in amongst humans. Generally, characteristics and
skills are relatively unaffected, though such a mutant may have claws
(1D6 slashing damage), a pointed beak or teeth (1D4 impaling damage).
At your gamemasterâ€™s discretion, the major version of this mutation
includes the Natural Weaponry minor mutation (below) at no cost to
CON. This can be improved to a major mutation normally.
