Reputation measures a character’s fame, notoriety, and renown.
It includes one’s family background, if relevant, and any actions they’ve done to earn a reputation. As a character’s Reputation increases, people grow increasingly aware of them, knowing more and more about them.
#### Gaining Reputation
Reputation is gained by doing things that gain the attention of others. Getting into the news, getting elected to office, doing something big and noteworthy, becoming a celebrity, helping someone famous, owning a famous item—these are all examples of things that can increase a character’s Reputation.
Reputation does not increase because of experience checks. Instead, it is increased at the gamemaster’s discretion, based on achievements and events that occur during play. Reputation can also increase through negative deeds. It does not decrease as passions do: behaving dishonorably, doing evil, failing spectacularly can make one just as famous (or even more so) than epic accomplishments.
The Reputation Gains table (below) provides examples about how Reputation might increase. Note that actions must be known to others— Reputation is gained for actions taken in secrecy or obscurity. The gamemaster is encouraged to use these examples as listed or to use them as guidelines for other increases.
Reputation from a single act provides only one gain, though the gamemaster may modify it for multiple occurrences of the same action, up to the total of the possible roll. If you’re using passions (page 214), it’s possible to gain Reputation for an act and lose Honor for it at the same time.
#### Tracking Reputation
The player should track the sources of their character’s Reputation and how much has been gained. Again, once Reputation has increased, it does not decrease.
One merely becomes famous for different things. The gamemaster may, however, modify its chance of success (see Reputation Modifiers, page 218).
#### Using Reputation
Reputation is used in two ways: to identify someone, or to impress others (essentially saying “Do you know who I am?”).
##### Identifying Someone
Reputation may be used by the gamemaster to have nonplayer characters identify a character and the reason they’re famous, or the players can roll to see if their characters have heard of a particular nonplayer character.
Apply any appropriate Reputation bonuses or penalties (see Reputation Modifiers, page 218) and roll. This is different than usual skills or characteristics, in that rolls are against the subject’s Reputation, not one’s own. A character may try to augment their Reputation (or someone else’s) with some sort of Communication skill, essentially talking someone up. If appropriate, a Knowledge or Lore skill might be used to augment a subject’s Reputation if they are notable in that field.
If the roll succeeds, the one whose reputation was rolled against is recognized. This likely affects how the nonplayer character reacts to the character. Better qualities successes yield more information. Failure means they’re not known, and a fumble means a disastrous misunderstanding or case of mistaken identity.
Someone can always try to deny who they are, but this grows increasingly difficult in more modern settings.
##### Impressing Others
Reputation may be used to try to augment some Communication skills, if appropriate. Similarly, the gamemaster may allow the character to attempt to sway a nonplayer character’s reaction to the character.
To use Reputation to augment another skill, roll against the character’s Reputation:
- Critical Success: The character’s Reputation adds a +50% bonus to the Communication skill to be used.
- Special Success: The character’s Reputation adds a +30% bonus to the Communication skill to be used.
- Success: The character’s Reputation adds a +20% bonus to the Communication skill to be used.
- Failure: The character subtracts –20% from the Communication skill to be used.
- Fumble: The character subtracts –50% from the Communication skill to be used.
#### Reputation Modifiers
Reputation is modified by the social distance of the audience. Usually, Reputation among family, place of employment, and neighborhood or home area is increased. On the other hand, Reputation diminishes with strangers and outsiders. Famous politicians, heroes, and celebrities might be completely unknown in distant places. Similarly, as time goes on, Reputations become less relevant. Add modifiers to a character’s Reputation based on the observer’s social proximity to them.
