The mutant can generate a type of light from their body, either faintly
glowing or in the form a beam of light from their eyes or some other
body part. The major version permits to emit a harsh beam of light,
able to temporarily blind an opponent if it is shone into their eyes with
a successful Agility roll: the target can Dodge to avoid the light. The
lightâ€™s color, intensity, and any ability to control or alter the light are
determined when the mutation is selected determine. It cannot be overly
complex, though potentially could be something like a wisp or ghostlike
image. Anything more sophisticated than a small ball of light requires an
Idea roll per combat round to manifest and control properly.
