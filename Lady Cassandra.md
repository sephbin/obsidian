I have a dilemma, and I'm looking for some advice. If you are currently playing a CoC game where there is an NPC called Thaddeus Preston, please do not read any further...

||I am running a homebrew mystery set in 1925, where a rich high society debutante - Mavis (20F) has gone missing. The investigators have discovered by looking through her date diary that about 7 to 8 months ago that she may have fallen pregnant, and that was likely with a character named Bradley. One of the investigators is a distant cousin of the missing person, and also knows of this Bradley, who happens to be a direct competitor/rival in the university fencing program. His character was seething when he found out that his sports rival was involved. My current problem is, that Bradley is dead., killed in an occult ritual involving a Hydra worshiping cult and an indoctrinated Mavis. AND The player of this investigator is now plotting to confront Bradley as part of the investigation, and they really seem to be enjoying the planning of it. I'm concerned that it's going to be a let down that they aren't going to be able to confront him or show off any of their fencing skills. It wasn't my initial intention to have Bradley be connected at all with any of the player characters, but once this specific player gave me a university student/athlete as their character, I thought it was worth giving them a hook later in the story.

Bradley's body is meant to be found near the climax of the first chapter, where the investigators come upon a massacre. A mythos monster summoned into Mavis as a host has uncontrollably killed most of the cult members and Bradley.

Should I write Bradley as if he never followed Mavis to the summoning ritual, and instead is oblivious to what happened, even to the pregnancy?
Should I bring Bradley back to life, in mythos ways, so he can be confronted by Mavis's cousin?
Should I create a doppleganger some way, so the player can confront Bradley, have their sword fight etc. But then stumble upon his rotting body later at the massacre site?
Or any other ideas?
Please, I'd love anyone's opinion on the matter?||
