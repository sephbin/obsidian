Higher Self

Angels suffer in sympathy with the earth and stand by us in the dark times of human existence. Despite everything they do not condemn, but love us with such devotion that we can scarcely comprehend it.



_The drawing room is dimly lit by flickering candles, casting dancing shadows on the walls. Lady Cassandra stands at the centre, her eyes half-closed, swaying slightly as she begins to chant in a low, melodic voice._



Lady Cassandra: (whispering) Spirits of the ethereal plane, I summon thee. (pauses, inhales deeply) Guardian of light, protector unseen, I beseech thee, come forth and guide me.

_She opens her eyes wide, their whites stark against the darkness, and begins to draw slowly on a large parchment with charcoal, her hand moving with an eerie grace._

Lady Cassandra: (voice rising) Oh, celestial guardian, hear my plea. (pauses, listening as if to an unseen presence) Guide my hand, guide my soul, to unveil the path shrouded in darkness. Show me the way to Mavis Preston.

_The charcoal scratches loudly against the paper, each stroke sharp and deliberate. She stops abruptly, her eyes focusing on the audience, piercing through the shadows._

Lady Cassandra: (commanding) You, watchers in the dark, join your energy with mine. Focus your minds, your hearts, on Mavis. Feel her fear, her desperation. We must find her, we must save her.

_She gestures to you all, reaching out her hand, people reluctantly come forward and chain hands together with her. A hand brushes past yours and holds on. The medium resumes drawing, her movements becoming more frenetic, almost violent. The shadows seem to close in tighter, the candle flames guttering. Your head is pounding, the sickly incense smoke in the air assaults your senses._

Lady Cassandra: (chanting) Angel of light, reveal the truth. Angel of light, banish the dark. Angel of light, show me the way.

_She shrieks with ecstasy!_

Lady Cassandra: We are graced with a higher precense.

_You see the medium looking directly into the eyes of a young lady in front of her, one of Mavis' friends._

Lady Cassandra: Child! You walk in the light of a mighty angel. We are all blessed.

_She pauses again, her breathing heavy, eyes darting around as if seeing something unseen by others._

	Make a POW roll.

_In the dim lighting, amidst the incesense smoke, you make out a ghostly structure swaying above the medium and the girl. They are almost impossible to see, ropy zephyrs limned in smoke, cascading from the ceiling. For a moment the two remind you of tangled marionettes. _

_The sick unearthly scene before you is interrupted with a flare of light. Lady Cassandra's veil flashes with blinding fire and a loud woosh. As your eyes adjust back to the darkness, she stands there half naked, still drawing frantically, her other arm stretched out with her palm on the girls forhead._

Lady Cassandra: I see... I see a place of confusion, a chaotic labyrinth. Mavis... she is trapped. Her cries echo in the silence of cacophony, ignored, unanswered.

_She draws faster, the lines forming unsettling shapes and symbols. The air grows heavy with an oppressive silence._

Lady Cassandra: (voice trembling) Guardian, reveal to us the protector. Show us the light that shields her. We must know, we must see.

_The final strokes of the drawing come in a frenzied rush. Cassandra steps back, revealing a disturbing, abstract depiction of a figure surrounded by swirling, chaotic lines, a serene abstract looping infinity hovering above._

Lady Cassandra: (whispering) There... there he is. Raphael, the angel that guards her, the light that shields her. Mavis is in peril, but she is not alone.

_She steps forward, her voice a chilling whisper that seems to reverberate through the room._

Lady Cassandra: (chanting) Lost in shadows, lost in mind, seek the light, the truth to find. Raphael, angel, guardian dear, dispel the darkness, calm our fear.

Lady Cassandra: (chanting) Angel of mercy, angel of light, pierce the veil, end the night. With your power, guide our way, bring us safely to the day.

_She raises her hands, and the candle flames flare up, casting the room into a sudden, stark illumination before plunging it back into darkness._

Lady Cassandra: (echoing) May the light protect us all.

_The room falls into a deep, uneasy silence, the image on the parchment staring back at the audience like an ominous prophecy._
