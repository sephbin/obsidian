The basement room is dark, with a wooden entry door, cobblestone floors and walls. Catholic symbology lines the walls which are lit by candlelight, from various braziers and a desk on the right wall. The back wall has a large circular plate adorned with red wax seals and parchments covered in writing. The room is filled with the smoke of incense, which billows from a sensor next to the door.

Down here, the droning sound of insects is finally silenced, and all that is left is the stifled sounds of shoes scuffing the ground and the sharp tinkle of chains. Occasionally you can hear the small coos of a baby.

The incense is a familiar smell, which empowers whatever smells you may get in a tropical dungeon.

There is a sense of trepidation and fear in the air, as thick as the smoke that wafts around the room.
