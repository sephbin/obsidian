A Cult of Narrative Determinism

**Beliefs:**

- **Existence as Performance:** The Weavers believe Thule, and everything within it, is a grand stage for the amusement of a cosmic audience. They are mere actors in a predetermined narrative, their lives scripted by the unseen hand of a divine author.
- **Liminal Particles as Proof:** The discovery of the liminal particle, capable of manipulating narrative threads, confirms their suspicions. They see it as a glimpse behind the curtain, revealing the strings that control their every move.
- **Gremlin's Gremlin Law as Divine Joke:** The success of rudimentary liminal particle experiments in proving Murphy's Law reinforces their belief. They see it as a cruel joke from the divine author, highlighting their powerlessness and the inevitability of misfortune.
- **Passive Acceptance:** The Weavers believe resistance is futile. They strive for acceptance and even embrace their roles, hoping to earn the favour of the divine audience and perhaps, one day, a modicum of agency.
- **Rituals and Performances:** Their rituals are elaborate theatrical performances aimed at pleasing the divine audience. They recite scripts believed to be fragments of the larger narrative, hoping to impress the author with their dedication.
- **Rejection of Free Will:** The Weavers reject the very notion of free will. They believe every choice, every action, is merely a preordained step in their narrative arc. This can lead to apathy or a fatalistic acceptance of their perceived destinies.

**Internal Divisions:**

- **The Fatalists:** Advocate for complete surrender to the narrative, seeking peace and acceptance in their predetermined roles.
- **The Rebels:** Driven by a desperate hope for agency, they seek ways to manipulate the liminal particle, rewrite their scripts, and defy the divine author.
- **The Interpreters:** Obsessed with deciphering the larger narrative, they analyse events and seek hidden meanings in every aspect of life, hoping to understand the grand play they are part of.

**Impact on Ultima Thule:**

- **Social Disruption:** Their beliefs can lead to apathy, withdrawal from society, or even acts of rebellion against perceived narrative constraints.
- **Political Influence:** The Weavers could become a powerful force, manipulating public opinion and influencing political decisions based on their interpretation of the narrative.
- **Philosophical Debates:** Their beliefs raise questions about free will, determinism, and the nature of reality in a universe governed by liminal particles.

**Potential Storylines:**

- **A Weavers' rebellion:** A group of radical Weavers discovers a way to manipulate the liminal particle, leading to a dangerous attempt to rewrite their narratives and challenge the divine author.
- **Unveiling the script:** A character stumbles upon fragments of the larger narrative, revealing the true purpose of Thule and the Weavers' role in it.
- **Escaping the stage:** A character, driven by a desperate desire for freedom, seeks to transcend the limitations of the narrative and find a way to exist outside the divine play.
